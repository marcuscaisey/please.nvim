--- MAPPINGS                                                     *please-mappings*
--- </pre>
---
--- please.nvim doesn't come with any mappings defined out of the box so that you can customise how you use it. Below
--- are some examples for each command to get you started.
---
--- Example Mappings~<br>
--- Lua:
--- <code>
---   vim.keymap.set('n', '<leader>pj', require("please").jump_to_target, { silent = true })
---   vim.keymap.set('n', '<leader>pb', require("please").build, { silent = true })
---   vim.keymap.set('n', '<leader>pt', require("please").test, { silent = true })
---   vim.keymap.set('n', '<leader>pct', function()
---     require('please').test { under_cursor = true}
---   end, { silent = true })
---   vim.keymap.set('n', '<leader>pr', require("please").run, { silent = true })
---   vim.keymap.set('n', '<leader>py', require("please").yank, { silent = true })
--- </code>
---
--- VimL:
--- <code>
---   nnoremap <leader>pj silent <cmd>Please jump_to_target<cr>
---   nnoremap <leader>pb silent <cmd>Please build<cr>
---   nnoremap <leader>pt silent <cmd>Please test<cr>
---   nnoremap <leader>pct silent <cmd>Please test under_cursor<cr>
---   nnoremap <leader>pr silent <cmd>Please run<cr>
---   nnoremap <leader>py silent <cmd>Please yank<cr>
--- </code>
---
--- <pre>
--- DEBUGGING                                                   *please-debugging*
--- </pre>
---
--- Debug logs can be enabled with
--- <code>
---   :Please toggle_debug_logs
--- </code>
---
--- This will enable some basic logging about which functions are being called with which arguments which should be
--- enough to solve most problems. It will also enable showing file / line numbers of error logs.
