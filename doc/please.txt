INTRODUCTION                                                    *please-intro*

please.nvim is a plugin which allows you interact with your Please repository
from the comfort of Neovim. The aim is to remove the need to switch from your
editor to the shell when performing routine actions.

Features ~
  • Build, run, test, and debug a target with |please.build()|,
    |please.run()|, |please.test()|, and |please.debug()|.
  • Display history of previous commands and run any of them again with
    |please.history()|.
  • Set the profile to use with |please.set_profile()|.
  • Jump from a source file to its build target definition with
    |please.jump_to_target()|.
  • Look up a build target by its build label with |please.look_up_target()|.
  • Yank a target's build label with |please.yank()|.
  • `please` configured as the 'filetype' for `BUILD`, `BUILD.plz`, `*.build`,
    and `*.build_defs` files.
  • `ini` configured as the 'filetype' for `.plzconfig` files to enable better
    syntax highlighting.
  • `please` LSP client configured to use `plz tool lps` for `please` files.
    See |please-lsp-client|.
  • gopls language server configured to use appropriate `GOROOT` when started
    in a Please respository. See |please-gopls-GOROOT|.
  • Python tree-sitter parser configured to be used for please files to enable
    better syntax highlighting and use of all tree-sitter features in build
    files.

USAGE                                                           *please-usage*
                                                                     *:Please*
Lua and VimL APIs ~
please.nvim commands can be called either through the Lua or the VimL API.
  • Commands are written in Lua and as such the Lua API should be preferred.
    It can't be guaranteed that all features available through the Lua API
    will also available through the VimL API.
  • The VimL API is mostly provided to make it easy to call commands from the
    command line.

To use the Lua API, you need to import the required module which will usually
be `please`. For instance, |please.jump_to_target()| is executed with
>lua
    local please = require('please')
    please.jump_to_target()
<
All available VimL API commands are autocompletable as arguments to the
`:Please` command. For instance, |please.jump_to_target()| is executed with
>
    :Please jump_to_target
<
UI Customisation ~
Some commands may prompt you to either choose from a list of options or input
some text. For example, when building a file which is an input to multiple
build targets, you'll be prompted to choose which target to build.

Input and selection prompts are provided by |vim.ui.input()| and
|vim.ui.select()| respectively. Doing so allows you to customise the
appearance of them to your taste. See |vim.ui| and the fantastic
https://github.com/stevearc/dressing.nvim for more information.

LSP CONFIGURATION                                          *please-lsp-config*

                                                           *please-lsp-client*
Please LSP Client ~
please.nvim configures the `please` LSP client to use `plz tool lps` for
`please` files using |vim.lsp.config()|. Call |vim.lsp.enable| to enable it:
>lua
    vim.lsp.enable('please')
<
                                                         *please-gopls-GOROOT*
Gopls GOROOT ~
The gopls language server uses the `GOROOT` environment variable to determine
where the standard library is located. The go-rules Please plugin allows
configuring the version of Go to use via the `GoTool` `.plzconfig` setting.

please.nvim configures `gopls` using |vim.lsp.config()| to use the appropriate
`GOROOT` when started in a Please repository, based on the `GoTool` setting.
This means that operations like jumping to a definition or listing references
with standard library modules will refer to the correct location for the
version of Go defined by the repository.
